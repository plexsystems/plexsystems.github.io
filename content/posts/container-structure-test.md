It is no secret that when we are writing software, tests are a critical component to ensuring that the code does what we say it does. It is so critical that most languages come with testing frameworks. JavaScript has testing frameworks such as [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/). Go ships with its own testing capabilities provided by the [testing package](https://golang.org/pkg/testing/). And while writing tests in these languages is an accepted standard practice, all too often, we forget that there's more to getting an application onto production than the app itself.

Dockerfiles play a big part in how we ship software at Plex. We use them heavily in our build pipelines to run [containerized jobs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/process/container-phases?view=azure-devops) as well as the distribution mechanism to get the software onto our Kubernetes clusters.  We like to say, "If it's code, we can test it." and that is no exception when it comes to writing our Dockerfiles.

## A traditional approach to writing Dockerfiles

When tasked with writing a Dockerfile, there are defined requirements that the Dockerfile needs to satisfy. Binaries may be required to run linting tools, environment variables may need to be set, and files need to exist in specific folder paths.

Consider the Dockerfile that was shown in an earlier blog post, [Deploying Atlantis for Azure DevOps onto Kubernetes](../deploying-infrastructure-azure/)

{{< gist jpreese f538d049246cb73639dafffa07153355 >}}

This Dockerfile requires:

- Terraform plugins
- The Terragrunt CLI
- Two environment variables, `TF_IN_AUTOMATION` and `TF_CLI_ARGS_init`
- Git configured with a helper script for Azure DevOps
- A configuration for the repository

To begin writing this Dockerfile, knowing that we'll need to install [terraform-bundle](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/tree/master/tools/terraform-bundle), using Go, and install the `unzip` package to `unzip` the bundle that was produced, we could jump right into it and create a `Dockerfile`:

{{< gist jpreese 9f092771d21ffb571d036eba3efa120b >}}

To verify that the base image exists and that the unzip package was successfully installed, we execute the `docker run` command with an interactive terminal to explore the contents of the produced container.

```shell
$ docker build . -t testing:latest
$ docker run -it testing:latest
root@fb06cc45835c:/go# unzip
UnZip 6.00 of 20 April 2009, by Debian. Original by Info-ZIP.
```

We know the `unzip` package successfully installed because after executing the binary, we got a response back that includes the version of the binary and the date it was built.

If the `unzip` package did not install successfully, we would see the container throwing an error stating that `unzip` is an unknown command.

```shell
$ docker run -it testing:latest
root@fb06cc45835c:/go# unzip
bash: unzip: command not found
```

This cycle of adding commands into the Dockerfile, building the image, running the container, and exploring the structure of the container would need to continue until we met all of the requirements.

While this process will allow us to satisfy all of the requirements, much of the verification was manual. Besides, when the requirements change, as they tend to do, it can be incredibly challenging to have confidence that we didn't inadvertently break anything else by introducing a change.

## A better way forward with Container Structure Test

[Container Structure Test](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/container-structure-test) is a tool developed by Google that enables us to test the structure of a container. I'm not sure how they came up with the name, but what's important is that it removes the need to test `Dockerfiles` manually!

Container Structure Test supports four different types of tests: `command`, `file existence`, `file content`, and `metadata`. Each type of test can validate a different aspect of a container. It does this by running the container for you, automatically, and testing whether or not the structure of the container meets the defined requirements in the test file.

If you want a deeper dive into the internals of Container Structure Test, the folks over at Google have a great [blog post](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/01/container-structure-tests-unit-tests.html) that explains the different types, as well as how to get the most out of the tool.

## Creating Dockerfiles with Container Structure Test

When equipped with Container Structure Test, rather than creating a new `Dockerfile`, adding commands, building the container, running the container, and manually exploring the containerâ€”we define the requirements upfront.

In the previous example, the first known requirement was that the `unzip` package had to be present inside of the container. To define this requirement as a test case within Container Structure Test, we use a`command` test:

{{< gist jpreese 2a2bf92a9cd3be3a4bac1248613a350f >}}

To test the Dockerfile, pass the name of the built image along with the location of the test file to the `container-structure-test` CLI.

```shell
$ docker build . -t testing:latest \ 
  && container-structure-test test --image testing:latest --config unzip-test.yaml

===================================
============= RESULTS =============
===================================
Passes:      1
Failures:    0
Duration:    443.548204ms
Total tests: 1
```

It's possible save some keystrokes, as well as time, by combining the `docker build` and `container-structure-test test` commands so that everytime the `Dockerfile` changes, a new image is built and the test suite is executed against the most recently built image.

While it's possible to create a single test and then pass the test inside of your `Dockerfile`, which is reminicent of Test-Driven development, another valid approach is to define _all_ your requirements first and build the `Dockerfile` from the test suite. Whichever approach makes the most sense for your style is the one you should use.

To complete our example of writing a test suite for the Atlantis container image, this is the completed test suite.

Integrating Container Structure Test into your workflow for developing `Dockerfiles` automates a lot of the manual exploration that was previously required to verify the structure of the container. As a bonus, when the `Dockerfile` is built, we have a test suite that we can run everytime we need to make a change to the `Dockerfile`.
